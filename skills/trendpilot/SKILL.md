# TrendPilot skill

Use this skill when a creator or brand needs trend signals turned into a structured brief, a repeatable content series, or repurposed drafts that work without on-camera audio.

## When to call each tool

- `trendpilot_brief`: Start here to generate a trend brief with angles, hooks, and faceless storyboard templates. Call when the user asks for trend signals or a content brief.
- `trendpilot_series`: Use after the brief to produce a 7–14 post series plan for a specific platform.
- `trendpilot_repurpose`: Use when the user provides source text and wants platform-specific drafts.

## Standard workflow

1) Call `trendpilot_brief` with niche, audience, platforms, and goal.
2) Call `trendpilot_series` to create the series plan for the chosen platform.
3) Call `trendpilot_repurpose` to produce platform drafts for the best-performing angle.

## Faceless mode checklist

- Prefer silent demos and screen recordings.
- Use clear captions and on-screen subtitles.
- Use simple b-roll and overlay text for emphasis.
- Avoid relying on narration or face camera shots.
